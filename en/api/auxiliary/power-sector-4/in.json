{"data": [{"note": "Electricity distribution companies in India had accumulated losses of INR 3,800bn ($56.9bn) and outstanding debt of INR 4,300bn ($64.3bn) as of March 2015. They have regularly defaulted on bank loans and are under considerable financial stress. The federal government has recognised this issue and launched a policy whereby state governments assume 75% of the debt held by the distribution companies, as it stood on September 2015. They will also take on future losses, but in a graded manner. The remaining 25% of debt is to be serviced by bonds issued by the electricity distribution companies. As of June 2016, 12 states had agreed to participate in the scheme, with more expected to join soon.", "values": [{"global_average": null, "value": 2.0, "year": 2015}], "name": "Power offtake risk for independent generators", "id": "q12"}], "meta": {"label-y": "", "label-x": ["Very low risk", "Low risk", "Neutral", "Risky", "Very risky"], "title": "Power sector structure"}, "iso": "in", "name": "in"}
