{"data": [{"note": "Tanesco continues to be classified as 'very high risk' this year, mainly due to its continued non-payment of IPPs. This has resulted in a cycle whereby the utility does not honour its payments; the IPP then seeks help from the Ministry of Energy and Minerals; a payment schedule is agreed and payment improves but not enough tp offset the debt; and then the cycle begins again. Tanesco is making efforts to pay off its debts in line with the 2014 roadmap, but it still operates at a loss and the plan to tackle its arrears is not yet clear. Unlike the banks, the IPPs cannot 'walk away', increasing the risk that payments to them will be pushed further out.
