While the BEC benefitted from a rate adjustment in July 2010 (the first in seven years), its cash flow problems were aggravated by a three-year government programme (2010\u201313) aimed at alleviating the impact of high electricity bills on residential customers at a time of economic distress. Under this programme, all residential customers (irrespective of income) were able to stretch out bill payments over three years at very favourable terms. As a result, BEC\u2019s accounts receivable decreased significantly \u2014 even as its payment for fuel inputs soared\u2014 forcing it to defer vital maintenance, take on additional loans, and accumulate arrears.  On the other hand, Grand Bahamas Power Company increased its profit and recorded $2.6m in earnings for the period of 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2013. Despite the GBPC profit increase, the credit-worthiness of offtakers was considered high because the private company owns only one fourth of the countries' installed capacity. The country's credit rating is stable.", "values": [{"global_average": null, "value": 1.0, "year": 2015}], "name": "Power offtake risk for independent generators", "id": "q12"}], "meta": {"label-y": "", "label-x": ["Very low risk", "Low risk", "Neutral", "Risky", "Very risky"], "title": "Power sector structure"}, "iso": "bs", "name": "bs"}
