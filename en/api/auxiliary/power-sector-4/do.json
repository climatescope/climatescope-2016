{"data": [{"note": "The Dominican Republic's power market is unstable and presents high risks for independent generators. In the last years, a few events demonstrated the risks linked to the Dominican Corporation of State-Owned Companies (CDEEE), including: a) Omissions and lack of accounting records of financial transactions in CDEEE. In 2010, KPMG affirmed that it \"could not obtain evidence of sufficient appropriate audit\" and did not express opinions about the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to continue business. b) On 18 March 2015, the Dominican Republic Camara de Cuentas affirmed that the CDEEE is working to solve the omissions issue. However, as of July 2016, a new audit report still had not been published. c) In April 2015, the country's power generators, through the Asociaci\u00f3n Dominicana de la Industria El\u00e9ctrica (ADIE), sent CDEEE a document with proposals for the fusion of the distribution and transmission companies.
