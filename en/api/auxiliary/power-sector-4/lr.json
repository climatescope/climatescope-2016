{"data": [{"note": "LEC is in debt and is entirely donor-funded, meaning there is very serious off-take risk. They operate on losses every fiscal year, and are currently spread thin working on four major transmission projects around Monrovia, so there is real concern about whether they could guarantee a connection with an IPP. Despite the country's signifcant demand for reliable on-grid electricity, it is questionable whether LEC could buy all the power generated by an IPP, were one to develop a project. With no independent energy regulator to enforce a PPA, the risk would be very high for an independent generator.", "values": [{"global_average": null, "value": 4.0, "year": 2015}], "name": "Power offtake risk for independent generators", "id": "q12"}], "meta": {"label-y": "", "label-x": ["Very low risk", "Low risk", "Neutral", "Risky", "Very risky"], "title": "Power sector structure"}, "iso": "lr", "name": "lr"}
