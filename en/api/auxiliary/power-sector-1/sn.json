{"data": [{"note": "Senelec, Senegal's national power company, continues to control transmission, distribution and retail of electricity in the country, apart from in rural electrification concessions where concession holders handle retail and distribution. Senelec has a monopscony until 2019 on the wholesale buying and selling of electricity. From 2019 onwards it may be possible for individual generators like Kououne Power to sell power directly to another stakeholder, depending on what happens in future legislation. Energy generation on the central grid system comes primarily from thermal power stations - Bel-Air and Cap-des-Biches, located close to Dakar, and the Kahone diesel power stations located in Kaolack, as well as from a hydro-electric dam located in Mali. In 2016, Senelec controls 74% (432.9MW) of the generation market with three private actors: Kounoune Power (67.5MW of diesel), Manatali (66MW of hydro from Mali, derived from the Senegal river) and Felou (15MW of hydro from Mali). The market share of independent power producers will increase in coming years as new solar and wind projects come online. 50 megawatts worth of solar PV projects are currently under construction and will connect to the grid at the by latest Q1 2017, and another 70MW worth have agreed contracts with Senelec. A 150MW wind project also has a contract signed and is awaiting financial close. Renewable energy development is seen as an important tool to meet energy deficiencies and contribute to reduction of poverty. The country benefits from 3,000 hours of solar irradiation on average per year, and an average wind strength of 5 meters per second. New conventional power projects: A new 125MW coal power station will come online in January 2018 on the Sendou site, developed by Conseil Economique et Social S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (CES), with another 125MW expected to be added in January 2020. It is being financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), a local bank and SMO - a Netherlands fund. Power will be sold to Senelec. Senegal has also recently discovered gas reserves off the Saint Louis coast, estimated at 450bn cubic meters, which is expected to be available from 2022. In expectation of this, new power stations are being built with capacity to operate both fuel and gas (once it becomes available). A new 52MW diesel power station at Cap des Biches is also expected to be operational from June 2016, developed by US company Contour Global, with a 30MW extention expected for January 2017. Senelec has also signed a contract with Tobene Power to build a 70MW diesel power station to be located at Taiba NDIAYE, with a 35MW extension forecast for January 2017.", "values": [{"global_average": null, "value": 1.0, "year": 2015}], "name": "The power sector has been unbundled (whether privatized or not) into distinct actors for generation, transmission, distribution and retail", "id": "q1"}, {"note": "Generation continues to be the only segment of Senegal's power system in which private companies operate.

CRSE is also recalculating tariff prices for the 2017 to 2019 period, and it is possible that electricity prices for the general public will be lowered due to lower commodity prices.

This creates a challenge for project developers because subcontractors do not benefit from the VAT removal. Contact between project developers and stakeholders like constructors, lawyers and debt providers can be slow and difficult, especially due to the sector's complicated governance structure.

It will offer between 50MW to 200MW and will finance the winning bidders via equity or debt (or both) and will also validate project agreements to ensure they are bankable and ideally can be completed within 24 months from the launch date.
