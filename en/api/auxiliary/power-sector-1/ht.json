As EDH lacks the capacity to provide electricity services throughout Haiti,HT, electrification efforts and minigrid development will need to involve independent producers, according to Haiti Sustainable Energy Roadmap. EDH's legal monopoly over distribution has arguably limited investment. Explicitly enabling IPPs to distribute electricity in parts of the country where EDH cannot provide power would significantly accelerate renewable energy deployment. Arrangements allowing IPPs to produce power on EDH's behalf have so far been negotiated bilaterally and in apparent conflict with the 1973 law granting EDH exclusive control over production, transmission and distribution. This has created a great deal of uncertainty and inconsistency for developers. In June 2014, the government launched an open call for local or international companies to assume EDH's role in the Southeast Department. The successful bidder will be awarded a concession to generate, transmit, distribute, and sell electricity within that area, and will be obligated to improve infrastructure and add sufficient capacity to provide electricity to all inhabitants. Ultimately, this model could be expanded throughout Haiti,HT, with the exception of the metropolitan area.
