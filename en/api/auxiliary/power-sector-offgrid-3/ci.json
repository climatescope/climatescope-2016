{"data": [{"note": "Solar PV products generally benefit from a reduced VAT rate - 9% against the 18% applied to most goods and services - and a reduced import duty of nil to 1%. However, securing such discounts is cumbersome, from both customs (for the duty exemption) and from the Ministry of Finance for the VAT reduction. Delays at customs can be costly as importers need to pay for warehouse space in the harbour.  These problems have led to considerable contraband imports from neighbouring Burkina Faso, where exemptions cover a wider set of components and are easier to access.", "values": [{"global_average": null, "value": 2.0, "year": 2015}], "name": "Off-grid solar VAT rate", "id": "q56"}], "meta": {"label-y": "", "label-x": ["High", "Medium", "Low"], "title": "Power sector structure"}, "iso": "ci", "name": "ci"}
