{"data": [{"note": "The Electricity Access Roll-out Plan is heavily dependent on donor funding. Between 2011 and 2015, the budget was $50m to $60m per year and mostly spent on increasing grid connections (75,000 households per year were connected on average). However, to meet its on-grid objective, the government estimates that this must be increased to $130m per year, excluding off-grid electrification. Thus, support for off-grid projects will essentially have to come from foreign development agencies and donors on a case-by-case basis. This picture will change radically in 2016. Donor-supported tenders for the electrification of 500,000 homes have been launched. The European Union has signed a financing agreement worth EUR 177m ($196m) for the energy sector, with a particular focus on rural electrification. The Renewable Energy Fund, backed by the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program, should go live with initial backing of $50m. It is looking to attract support from other donors to reach a target of $180m, all of which will be dedicated to off-grid electrification through home power systems and mini-grids. The government estimates the volume of debt needed for off-grid PV home installations to be $100m in 2016-17. Targeted investment in the mini-grid segment is $65m, including around $30m in support.", "values": [{"global_average": null, "value": 1.0, "year": 2015}], "name": "Rural electrification budget", "id": "q43"}, {"note": "Consumers within 30 metres of the grid pay RWF 56,000 (around $70) in instalments over five years.
